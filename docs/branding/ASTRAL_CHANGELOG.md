# Astral Branding Changelog

This changelog maps legacy UI terms to Astral-branded names. API routes and filenames generally remain unchanged to avoid breaking changes; branding applies to UI labels, icons, and documentation.

- Dashboard → Cosmic Dashboard
- Projects → Stellar Projects
- Characters → Stellar Beings
- Locations → Cosmic Realms
- Plotboard → Constellation Map
- Timelines → Temporal Nexus
- Analytics → Prism Analytics
- Publishing → Launch Sequence
- Backup → Cosmic Archive
- Comparison → Parallel Dimensions
- Sync → Quantum Sync
- Notes (contextual) → Stellar Notes (label)
- Editor (surface) → Stellar Scribe (in headers/microcopy)
- Link System submenu → Quantum Links (umbrella name)

Implemented:
- Centralized labels in `client/src/astral/astralBranding.ts`
- NavigationSidebar updated to consume constants (no visual changes).

Pending follow-ups:
- Replace page headers/microcopy to reflect Astral names across features.
- Timelines add view mode labels.
- Link system microcopy (Starhint, Starlight Glimpse, Echo Constellations).
