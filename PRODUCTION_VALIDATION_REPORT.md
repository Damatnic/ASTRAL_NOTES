## Critical Issues Requiring Attention

### 🚨 High Priority - Server TypeScript Issues
```
Status: BLOCKING PRODUCTION
Files Affected:
  - src/middleware/auth.ts
  - src/routes/auth.ts  
  - src/routes/characters.ts
  - src/routes/users.ts

Issues:
  - Missing return types in middleware functions
  - JWT configuration type conflicts
  - Prisma type compatibility issues
  - Optional property type mismatches

Impact: Server cannot be built for production
Timeline: Must be resolved before full-stack deployment
```

### ⚠️ Medium Priority - Development Dependencies
```
Status: ADVISORY
Issue: 6-10 moderate security vulnerabilities in dev dependencies
Packages: esbuild, vite, vitest
Impact: Development environment only, no production impact
Action: Monitor for updates, consider upgrading when stable versions available
```
